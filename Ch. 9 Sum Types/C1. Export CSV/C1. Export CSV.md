# Export CSV

Doc2Doc should be able to prepare and export a CSV file of whatever data you input. Comma-Separated Values are a ubiquitous text format that allows for information to be structured in a table. There is usually a header row, followed by data rows. Within rows, items are separated by commas.

## Assignment

Complete the `get_csv_status` function. It should use a match case statement to select the correct response depending on the status of the export operation. Create functions to handle each operation as follows:

### PENDING:

Return a tuple with the string `"Pending..."` and the data converted from a list of lists of anything, to a list of lists of strings. Try to use nested map functions to convert the data items into strings. Remember to convert from a map object back into a list.

### PROCESSING:

Return a tuple with the string `"Processing..."` and the data converted from a list of lists of strings into one string in CSV format.

- For each list of strings, combine the strings with `join` with commas inbetween to form a row.
- For each row string, combine the strings with `join` with newlines `"\n"` inbetween to form a table.

### SUCCESS:

Return a tuple with the string `"Success!"` and simply return the data as is.

### FAILURE:

Return a tuple with the string `"Unknown error, retrying..."` and the data after it has been prepared and processed into a CSV string, by combining the steps for `Pending` and `Processing`.

### Any Other Status:

If the input status is none of the above, raise an `Exception` with the string `"unknown export status"`.

## Tip

It's better if you try this challenge without using loops for practice, but you may use loops.
