# Sum Types

Remember when I said, "Pure functions are my favorite part of functional programming"? Well, [sum types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union) are a close second.

A "sum" type is the opposite of a "product" type. This Python object is an example of a _product_ type:

```py
man.studies_finance = True
man.has_trust_fund = False
```

The total number of combinations a `man` can have is `4`, the _product_ of `2 * 2`:

|studies_finance|has_trust_fund|
|---|---|
|True|True|
|True|False|
|False|True|
|False|False|

If we add a third attribute, perhaps a `has_blue_eyes` boolean, the total number of possibilities multiplies again, to 8!

|studies_finance|has_trust_fund|has_blue_eyes|
|---|---|---|
|True|True|True|
|True|True|False|
|True|False|True|
|True|False|False|
|False|True|True|
|False|True|False|
|False|False|True|
|False|False|False|

But let's pretend that we live in a world where there are _really_ only [three types of people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEt0IuQJX2o) that our program cares about:

1. Dateable
2. Undateable
3. Maybe dateable

We can _reduce_ the number of cases our code needs to handle by using a (admittedly fake Pythonic) sum type with only 3 possible _types_:

```py
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Dateable(Person):
    pass

class MaybeDateable(Person):
    pass

class Undateable(Person):
    pass
```

Then we can use the [isinstance](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance) built-in function to check if a `Person` is an instance of one of the subclasses. It's a clunky way to represent sum types, but hey, it's Python.

```py
def respond_to_text(guy_at_bar):
    if isinstance(guy_at_bar, Dateable):
        return f"Hey {guy_at_bar.name}, I'd love to go out with you!"
    elif isinstance(guy_at_bar, MaybeDateable):
        return f"Hey {guy_at_bar.name}, I'm busy but let's hang out sometime later."
    elif isinstance(guy_at_bar, Undateable):
        return "Have you tried being rich?"
    else:
        raise ValueError("invalid person type")
```

## Sum Types

As opposed to product types, which can have many (often infinite) combinations, sum types have a _fixed_ number of possible values. To be clear: **Python doesn't really support sum types**. We have to use a workaround and invent our own little system and enforce it ourselves.

## Assignment

Whenever a document is parsed by Doc2Doc, it can either succeed or fail. In functional programming, we often represent errors as data (e.g. the `ParseError` class) rather than by `raise`ing exceptions, because exceptions are side effects. _(This isn't standard Python practice, but it's useful to understand from an FP perspective)_

**Complete the `Parsed` and `ParseError` subclasses.**

- `Parsed` represents success. It should accept a `doc_name` string and a `text` string and save them as properties of the same name.
- `ParseError` represents failure. It should accept a `doc_name` string and an `err` string and save them as properties of the same name.

The test suite uses the `isinstance` function to see if an error occurred based on the class type.
