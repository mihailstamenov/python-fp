# Enums

Doing the admittedly weird `class` and `isinstance()` thing works, but it turns out, there's a better way in some cases. If you're trying to represent a fixed set of values (but not store additional data within them) [enums](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html) are the way to go.

Let's say we have a `Color` variable that we want to restrict to only three possible values:

- `RED`
- `GREEN`
- `BLUE`

We could use a plain-old `string` to represent these values, but that's annoying because we have to remember all the "valid" values and defensively check for invalid ones all over our codebase. Instead, we can use an `Enum`:

```py
from enum import Enum

Color = Enum('Color', ['RED', 'GREEN', 'BLUE'])
print(Color.RED)  # this works, prints 'Color.RED'
print(Color.TEAL) # this raises an exception
```

Now `Color` is a sum type! _At least, as close as we can get in Python._

There are a few benefits:

1. A "Color" can only be `RED`, `GREEN`, or `BLUE`. If you try to use `Color.TEAL`, Python raises an exception.
2. There is a central place to see the "valid" values for a `Color`.
3. Each "Color" has a "name" (e.g. `Color.RED`) and a "value" (e.g. `1`). The value is an integer and is used under the hood instead of the name. Integers take up less memory than strings, which helps with performance.

## Tip

Don't forget to `import` the `Enum` class from the `enum` module!
