# Reduce

The built-in [functools.reduce()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce) function takes a function and a list of values, and applies the function to each value in the list, _accumulating a single result_ as it goes.

![reduce function](../../00.%20images/YU2hRLU.png)

```py
# import functools from the standard library
import functools

def add(sum_so_far, x):
    print(f"sum_so_far: {sum_so_far}, x: {x}")
    return sum_so_far + x

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sum = functools.reduce(add, numbers)
# sum_so_far: 1, x: 2
# sum_so_far: 3, x: 3
# sum_so_far: 6, x: 4
# 10 doesn't print, it's just the final result
print(sum)
# 10
```

## Assignment

Complete the `join` and the `join_first_sentences` functions.

### join()

This is a helper function we'll use in `join_first_sentences`. It takes two inputs:

1. A "doc_so_far" accumulator string. It's similar to the `sum_so_far` variable in the example above.
2. A "sentence" string. This is the next string we want to add to the accumulator.

It returns the result of concatenating the "doc" and "sentence" strings together, with a period and a space in between. For example:

```py
doc = "This is the first sentence"
sentence = "This is the second sentence"
print(join(doc, sentence))
# This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence
```

### join_first_sentences()

It accepts two arguments:

1. A list of sentence strings
2. An integer `n`

It should use the built-in [functools.reduce()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce) function alongside your `join` function to return a single string: the result of joining the _first_ `n` sentences in the list. It should also add a final period (but no trailing space) to the end of the final "reduced" string.

If `n` is zero, just return an empty string.

Use [list slicing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations) to get the first `n` sentences. For example:

```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print(fruits[:2])
# ["apple", "banana"]
```

Here's an example of the expected behavior:

```py
joined = join_first_sentences(
    ["This is the first sentence", "This is the second sentence", "This is the third sentence"],
    2
)
print(joined)
# This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.
```
