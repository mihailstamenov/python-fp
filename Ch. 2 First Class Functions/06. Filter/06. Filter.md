# Filter

The built-in [filter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter) function takes a function and an iterable (in this case a list) and returns a _new_ iterable that only contains elements from the original iterable where the result of the function on that item returned `True`.

![filter function](../../00.%20images/FfVxD7d.png)

In Python:

```py
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
print(evens)
# [2, 4, 6]
```

## Assignment

Complete the `remove_invalid_lines` function. It accepts a document as input. It should:

1. [ ] Use the built-in `filter` function and a lambda to return a copy of the input document
2. [ ] _Remove_ any lines that start with a `-` character.
3. [ ] Keep _all_ other lines and **preserve trailing newlines**.

For example, this:

```
* Star Wars episode 1 is underrated
- Star Wars episode 9 is fine
* Star Wars episode 3 is the best

```

Should become:

```
* Star Wars episode 1 is underrated
* Star Wars episode 3 is the best

```

## Tips

The `splitlines` method does not preserve trailing newlines and may cause your output to fail the tests.

The following methods may be useful:

[.join](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join)

```py
"\n".join(["a", "b", "c"])
# a
# b
# c
```

[.startswith](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith)

```py
s = "hello"
s.startswith("h")
# True
s.startswith("o")
# False
```

[.split](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split)

```py
s = """hello
world"""
lines = s.split("\n")
# ['hello', 'world']
```
