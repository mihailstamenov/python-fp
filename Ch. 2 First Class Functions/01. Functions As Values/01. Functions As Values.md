# Functions As Values

In Python, functions are just values, like strings, integers, or objects. For example, we can assign an existing function to a variable:

```py
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# assign the function to a new variable
# called "addition". It behaves the same
# as the original "add" function
addition = add
print(addition(2, 5))
# 7
```

## Assignment

With the popularity of generative AI (like ChatGPT), we need to be able to convert files into pure text to be injected into prompts.

**Complete the `file_to_prompt` function.** It should take a `file` dictionary and a `to_string` function as inputs and return a formatted string. The provided `to_string` function is responsible for converting the file dictionary into a string: you don't need to implement it, it's a value passed to your function.

However, your function should wrap the result of the `to_string` function in triple backticks (` ``` `) to format it as a [code block in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code). For example:

```
an example string
```

should become:

````md
```
an example string
```
````

## Tips

Notice the two newlines in the example above! You don't need a trailing newline, but you do need the 2 newlines between the triple backticks. You can achieve this by using the newline [`\n`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) escape character. Here's an example:

```py
print("I wish the ring had never come to me.\nI wish none of this had happened.")
```

becomes:

```
I wish the ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
```
