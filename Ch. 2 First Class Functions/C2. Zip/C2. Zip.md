# Zip

The [zip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) function takes two iterables (in this case lists), and returns a _new_ iterable where each element is a tuple containing one element from each of the original iterables.

```py
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]

c = list(zip(a, b))
print(c)
# [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
```

## Assignment

Complete the `pair_document_with_format` function. It takes two lists as input: `doc_names` and `doc_formats`. Each list contains strings. The `doc_names` list contains the names of documents, and the `doc_formats` list contains the file formats of the documents.

First, `zip` up the lists into a single list of tuples with the names as the first index and the formats as the second index in each tuple.

Next, [filter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter) the list of tuples to only include tuples where the format is one of the given `valid_formats`.

Return the result.

> Sidenote: This is exactly the kind of validation we often need in real-world applications, like when building a document upload system where we only want to accept certain file types.
