# Restore

Doc2Doc needs a way to restore documents from saved backups. However, not all original documents may have backups, and some backups might be corrupted.

## Assignment

Complete the `restore_documents` function in one line - if you can. It takes two tuples of document strings, `originals` and `backups`, as input and returns a `set`.

1. [ ] Convert all documents to the same case with `.upper()` for comparison.
2. [ ] Filter out documents that are corrupted strings of random numbers with `.isdigit()`.
3. [ ] Return the combined `originals` and `backups` tuples, removing any duplicates using a `set`.

## Tip

I used `map`, `filter` and lambda functions to complete the function on one line, but it's split up by multi-line formatting for your readability.
