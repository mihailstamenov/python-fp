# Map, Filter, and Reduce Review

Higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, allow us to avoid stateful iteration and mutations of variables.

Take a look at this [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) code that calculates the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a number:

```py
def factorial(n):
    # a procedure that continuously multiplies
    # the current result by the next number
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

Here's the same factorial function using `reduce`:

```py
import functools

def factorial(n):
    return functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, range(1, n + 1))
```

In the functional example, we're just combining functions to get the result we want. There's no need to reassign variables or keep track of the program's state in a loop.

A loop is inherently stateful. Depending on which iteration you're on, the `i` variable has a different value.
