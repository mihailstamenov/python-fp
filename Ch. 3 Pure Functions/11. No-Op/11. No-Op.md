# No-Op

A [no-op](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)) is an operation that does... nothing.

If a function doesn't return anything, it's probably impure. If it doesn't return anything, the only reason for it to exist is to perform a side effect.

## Example No-Op

This function performs a useless computation because it doesn't return anything or perform a side-effect. It's a no-op.

```py
def square(x):
    x * x
```

## Example Side-Effect

This function performs a side effect. It changes the value of the `y` variable that is outside of its scope. It's impure.

```py
y = 5
def add_to_y(x):
    global y
    y += x

add_to_y(3)
# y = 8
```

_The [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) keyword just tells Python to allow access to the outer-scoped `y` variable._

## print()

Even the `print()` function (technically) has an impure side effect! It doesn't return anything, but it does print text to the console, which is a form of i/o.

## Assignment

Complete the `remove_emphasis`, `remove_emphasis_from_line`, and `remove_emphasis_from_word` functions. They are currently no-ops.

`remove_emphasis` is the parent function. It takes a full document with any number of lines and removes any single _or double_ `*` characters that are at the start or end of a word. ([Emphasis](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#emphasis) in markdown)

For example, this:

```
I *love* markdown.
I **really love** markdown.
```

Should become:

```
I love markdown.
I really love markdown.
```

Write the helper functions, they will make the `remove_emphasis` function much easier to write:

- The `remove_emphasis_from_word` function should remove emphasis from a single word.
- The `remove_emphasis_from_line` function should split a given line into words and use the function we just created to remove emphasis from each word.

## Tips

For the sake of practice, try it without the `.replace()` string method. I used some of these built-ins:

- [str.split](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split)
- [str.strip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip)
- [map](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map)
- [join](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join)
