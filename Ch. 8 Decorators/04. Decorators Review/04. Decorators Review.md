# Decorators Review

A Python decorator is just [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) for [higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function). "Syntactic sugar" just means "a more convenient syntax".

_Not all programming languages_ have built-in decorators, but most _do_ support higher-order functions and closures.

Some of the famous [functional languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming) like:

- [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_\(programming_language\))
- [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_\(programming_language\))
- [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure)
- [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_\(programming_language\))

do _not_ have special syntax decorators, but they do have higher-order functions and closures, meaning the [decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) can still be used. So, if you understand those concepts, they will serve you well in many different languages.

Function decorators are not as often supported as 'plain' higher-order functions.

Function currying, higher-order functions, and first class functions are commonplace in most programming languages.
