# Decorators

[Python decorators](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/decorators.html) are just [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) for [higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function).

**Example:**

```py
def vowel_counter(func_to_decorate):
    vowel_count = 0
    def wrapper(doc):
        nonlocal vowel_count
        vowels = "aeiou"
        for char in doc:
            if char in vowels:
                vowel_count += 1
        print(f"Vowel count: {vowel_count}")
        return func_to_decorate(doc)
    return wrapper

@vowel_counter
def process_doc(doc):
    print(f"Document: {doc}")

process_doc("What")
# Vowel count: 1
# Document: What

process_doc("a wonderful")
# Vowel count: 5
# Document: a wonderful

process_doc("world")
# Vowel count: 6
# Document: world
```

The `@vowel_counter` line is "decorating" the `process_doc` function with the `vowel_counter` function. `vowel_counter` is called once when `process_doc` is defined with the `@` syntax, but the `wrapper` function that it returns is called every time `process_doc` is called. That's why `vowel_count` is preserved and printed after each time.

## It's Just Syntactic Sugar

Python decorators are just another (sometimes simpler) way of writing a higher-order function. These two pieces of code are _identical_:

### With Decorator

```py
@vowel_counter
def process_doc(doc):
    print(f"Document: {doc}")

process_doc("Something wicked this way comes")
```

### Without Decorator

```py
def process(doc):
    print(f"Document: {doc}")

process_doc = vowel_counter(process)
process_doc("Something wicked this way comes")
```

## Assignment

The provided `file_type_aggregator` function is intended to decorate other functions. It assumes that the function it decorates has exactly 2 positional arguments.

**Create a `process_doc` function** that's decorated by `file_type_aggregator`. It should return the following string:

```py
f"Processing doc: '{doc}'. File Type: {file_type}"
```

Where `doc` and `file_type` are its positional arguments. (See line 11 for where it's being called)
