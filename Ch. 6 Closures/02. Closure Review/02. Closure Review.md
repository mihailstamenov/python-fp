# Closure Review

The whole point of a closure is that it's _stateful_. It's a function that "remembers" the values from the enclosing scope even after the enclosing scope has finished executing.

It's as if you're saving the state of a function at a particular point in time, and then you can use and update that state later on.

```py
def concatter():
	doc = ""
	def inner_func(word):
		# "nonlocal" tells Python to use the doc
		# variable from the enclosing scope
		nonlocal doc
		doc += word + " "
		return doc
	return inner_func

harry_potter_aggregator = concatter()
harry_potter_aggregator("Mr.")
harry_potter_aggregator("and")
harry_potter_aggregator("Mrs.")
harry_potter_aggregator("Dursley")
harry_potter_aggregator("of")
harry_potter_aggregator("number")
harry_potter_aggregator("four,")
harry_potter_aggregator("Privet")

print(harry_potter_aggregator("Drive"))
# Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive
```

That means that in many cases, closures are _not_ pure functions. They can mutate state outside of their scope and have side effects.

A closure can change the value of a variable outside its body
A function that changes nonlocal variables is not a pure function.
