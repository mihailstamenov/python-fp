# Line Breaking

Users should be able to break lengthy text into manageable lines. Lineation is simply dividing text into lines. This concept can also be applied to other data structures, such as code blocks or formatted paragraphs.

## Assignment

Complete the inner `add_word_to_lines` function. It takes a list of strings, `lines`, and a string `word`, as inputs and returns `lines` with the `word` added.

1. [ ] If `lines` is empty, return just `word` in a list
2. [ ] Assign the last line in `lines` to `current_line`
3. [ ] If the length of `current_line` and `word` plus one (for a space) is more than `line_length`, start a new line by appending `word` to `lines`
4. [ ] Else, add `word` to `current_line` with a space, and assign the new string to the last index in `lines`
5. [ ] Remember to return `lines`

_Note: Every line will have at least one word, even if that word is longer than the `line_length`._

```py
lineate = lineator(11)
lines = lineate("Boots loves salmon because he is a bear.")
# lines: ["Boots loves", "salmon", "because he", "is a bear."]
```
