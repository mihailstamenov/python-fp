# Copy/Paste

Doc2Doc has a simple clipboard for copying to and pasting from a cache. Initialize the clipboard to set and get strings.

## Assignment

Complete the `new_clipboard` function. It accepts a dictionary as input and returns two functions, `copy_to_clipboard` and `paste_from_clipboard`. It should not modify the original input dictionary.

- `copy_to_clipboard`: It takes a `key` and `value` string pair and adds them to the clipboard dictionary.
- `paste_from_clipboard`: It takes a `key` string and returns its value from the clipboard dictionary. If the key is missing from the clipboard, return an empty string.
