# User Words

Doc2Doc has a spellchecker, but users often use slang words that aren't recognized. Create a feature to allow users to add their own words to the spellchecker.

## Assignment

Complete the 'user_words' function. It accepts a tuple of `initial_words` as input and returns a function, `add_word`. Since tuples are immutable, you don't need to worry about modifying the `initial_words`. `add_word` should add a new `word` string to the words and return all words as a tuple.
