# Why Curry?

It's fairly obvious that:

```py
def sum(a, b):
  return a + b
```

is simpler than:

```py
def sum(a):
  def inner_sum(b):
    return a + b
  return inner_sum
```

So why would we _ever_ want to do the more complicated thing? Well, currying is often used to **change a function's signature** to make it conform to a specific shape. For example:

```py
def colorize(converter, doc):
  # ...
  converter(doc)
  # ...
```

The `colorize` function accepts a function called `converter` as input, and at some point during its execution, it calls `converter` with a single argument. That means that it expects `converter` to accept exactly one argument. So, if I have a conversion function like this:

```py
def markdown_to_html(doc, asterisk_style):
  # ...
```

I can't pass `markdown_to_html` to `colorize` because `markdown_to_html` wants _two_ arguments. To solve this problem, I can curry `markdown_to_html` into a function that takes a single argument:

```py
def markdown_to_html(asterisk_style):
  def asterisk_md_to_html(doc):
    # do stuff with doc and asterisk_style...

  return asterisk_md_to_html

markdown_to_html_italic = markdown_to_html('italic')
colorize(markdown_to_html_italic, doc)
```

When passing a function around to be called later, it does matter how many arguments the function accepts. Thus, you should only curry when it serves a clear purpose.
