# It's Math

Functional programming tends to be popular amongst developers with a strong mathematical background. After all, a math equation isn't procedural: it's declarative. Take the following math equation:

```
avg = Σx/N
```

To put this calculation in plain English:

1. `Σ` is just the Greek letter [Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma), and it represents "the [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) of a collection".
2. `x` is the collection of numbers we're averaging.
3. `N` is the number of elements in the collection.
4. `avg` is equal to the sum of all the numbers in collection "x" divided by the number of elements in collection "x".

So, the equation really just says that `avg` is the average of all the numbers in collection "x". This math equation is a _declarative_ way of writing "calculate the average of a list of numbers". Here's some _imperative Python code_ that does the same thing:

```py
def get_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    return total / len(nums)
```

However, with functional programming, we would write code that's _a bit more_ declarative:

```py
def get_average(nums):
    return sum(nums) / len(nums)
```

Here we're not keeping track of state (the `total` variable in the first example is ["stateful"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)#:~:text=In%20information%20technology%20and%20computer,known%20as%20its%20state%20space.)). We're simply composing functions together to get the result we want.

## Assignment

In the world of document conversion, we sometimes need to handle fonts and font sizes.

Complete the `get_median_font_size` function. Given a list of numbers representing font sizes, return the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of the list.

For example:

```
[1, 2, 3] => 2
[10, 8, 7, 5] => 7
```

Notice the second list is out of order. Order the list, then find the middle index, and return the middle number. If there is an even amount of numbers, return the smaller of the two middle numbers (I know it's not a _true_ median, but good for our purposes). If the list is empty, just return `None`.

Here are some helpful docs:

- [sorted](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted)
- [len](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len)
- [//](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex) (floor division)

To be a good little functional programmer, your code for this lesson should **not**:

1. Use loops
2. Mutate any variables (it's okay to create new ones)
