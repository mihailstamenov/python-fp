# Why Python?

Frankly, Python is _not_ the best language for functional programming. Reasons include:

1. No [static typing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing).
2. (Almost) everything is [mutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object).
3. No [tail call optimization](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_tail-calls.html).
4. [Side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)) are common.
5. Imperative and OOP styles abound in popular libraries.
6. [Purity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) is not enforced (and sometimes not even encouraged).
7. [Sum Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) are hard to define.
8. [Pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching) is weak at best.

So seriously, why are we using Python? One reason trumps all others: _you already know Python_. Python is a great choice for learning coding basics, OOP, Algorithms, and Data Structures, and the _tradeoff of learning a new language at this point_ in the curriculum isn't worth it.

We can still cover the most important concepts of functional programming in Python, even if we have to jump through a hoop or two to do it. Functional programming is a paradigm of useful techniques for writing better code, and they apply to all languages, not just purely functional ones.

Note: We also plan to release a "Functional Programming 2" course in a more functional language. Likely one of these:

- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
