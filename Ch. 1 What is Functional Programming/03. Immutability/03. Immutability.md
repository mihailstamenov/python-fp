# Immutability

In FP, we strive to make data _[immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)_. Once a value is created, it cannot be changed. _Mutable_ data, on the other hand, can be changed after it's created.

## Who Cares?

Immutable data is easier to think about and work with. When 10 different functions have access to the same variable, and you're debugging a problem with that variable, you have to consider the possibility that any of those functions could have changed the value.

When a variable is immutable, you can be sure that it hasn't changed since it was created. It's a helluva lot easier to work with.

_Generally speaking, immutability means fewer bugs and more maintainable code._

## Tuples vs. Lists

Tuples and lists are both ordered collections of values, but tuples are _immutable_ and lists are _mutable_.

You can append to a list, but you can _not_ append to a tuple. You can create a _new copy_ of a tuple using values from an existing tuple, but you can't change the existing tuple.

### Lists Are Mutable

```python
ages = [16, 21, 30]
# 'ages' is being changed in place
ages.append(80)
# [16, 21, 30, 80]
```

### Tuples Are Immutable

```python
ages = (16, 21, 30)
more_ages = (80,) # note the comma! It's required for a single-element tuple
# 'all_ages' is a brand new tuple
all_ages = ages + more_ages
# (16, 21, 30, 80)
```

## Assignment

The `add_prefix` function accepts 2 arguments:

- "document": a string
- "documents": the current tuple of strings

It should do 2 things:

- Add a prefix of `X.` to the beginning of the new `document`, where `X` is the next index in the tuple. (The first document should be `0.` , next should be `1.` , etc.)
- Return the `documents` tuple with the new `document` added to the end.

1. **Run the code to see the error.** Whoever wrote this code assumed that `documents` is a list, but it's a tuple!
    
2. **Fix the bug.** Instead of attempting to _mutate_ the input tuple, create a brand new tuple with the new document added to the end and return that.# Immutability
