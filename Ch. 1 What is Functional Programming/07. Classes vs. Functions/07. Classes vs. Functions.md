# Classes vs. Functions

I run into new developers who, after learning about classes, want to use them _everywhere_. They assume that because they learned about functions first, functions are somehow inferior.

**Nope.** They're just different.

## Should I Use Functions or Classes?

Here's my rule of thumb:

**If you're unsure, default to functions.** I find myself reaching for classes when I need something long-lived and stateful that would be easier to model if I could share behavior _and data structure_ via inheritance. This is often the case for:

- Video games
- Simulations
- GUIs

The difference is:

> **Classes** encourage you to think about the world as a hierarchical collection of objects. Objects bundle behavior, data, and state together in a way that draws boundaries between instances of things, like chess pieces on a board.

> **Functions** encourage you to think about the world as a series of data transformations. Functions take data as input and return a transformed output. For example, a function might take the entire state of a chess board and a move as inputs, and return the new state of the board as output.

_Use what feels right to you in your projects, and adjust and refactor as you improve your skills._
