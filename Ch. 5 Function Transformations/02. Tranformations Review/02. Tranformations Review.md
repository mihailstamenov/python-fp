# Transformations Review

Example of a function transformation:

```py
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def self_math(math_func):
    # inner_func is defined inside self_math.
    # It can only be referenced directly
    # inside self_math's scope. However, it is then
    # returned and can be captured into a new variable
    # like square_func or double_func, and called that way
    def inner_func(x):
        return math_func(x, x)
    return inner_func

square_func = self_math(multiply)
double_func = self_math(add)

print(square_func(5))
# 25

print(double_func(5))
# 10
```

What does the expression 'self_math(add)' return?
Where can 'inner_func' be referenced directly?
