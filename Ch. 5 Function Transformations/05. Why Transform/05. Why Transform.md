# Why Transform?

You might be wondering:

- "When would I use function transformations in the real world?"
- "Isn't it simpler to just define functions at the top level of the code, and call them as needed?"

Good questions. To be clear, we don't just transform functions at [runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_\(computing\)#Runtime) for the fun of it! We only use advanced techniques like function transformations when they make our code _simpler than it would otherwise be_.

## Code Reusability

Creating variations of the same function dynamically can make it a lot easier to share common functionality. Take a look at this `formatter` function. It accepts a "pattern" and returns a new function that formats text according to that pattern:

```py
def formatter(pattern):
    def inner_func(text):
        result = ""
        i = 0
        while i < len(pattern):
            if pattern[i:i+2] == '{}':
                result += text
                i += 2
            else:
                result += pattern[i]
                i += 1
        return result
    return inner_func
```

Now we can create new formatters easily:

```py
bold_formatter = formatter("**{}**")
italic_formatter = formatter("*{}*")
bullet_point_formatter = formatter("* {}")
```

And use them like this:

```py
print(bold_formatter("Hello"))
# **Hello**
print(italic_formatter("Hello"))
# *Hello*
print(bullet_point_formatter("Hello"))
# * Hello
```

## Closures

90% of the time, when I use function transformations, it's because I want to create a closure. We'll talk about closures in the next chapter!
