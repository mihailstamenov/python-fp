# Upgrade Filter Command

Users like the filter command, but think it could be better. They want access to more than two filter options and to customize the words that get filtered. It's time to upgrade the filter command feature.

## Assignment

1. Complete the `get_filter_cmd` function. It should take a dictionary as input, `filters`, and return a function, `filter_cmd`.

- `filters` contains option string and filter function key/value pairs.

2. `filter_cmd` should take as input a string `content` to be filtered, a list of strings `options`, and a list of tuples `word_pairs`.

- The `filter_cmd` should filter and return the `content`, filtered according to the input `options`
- If there are no options in the `options` list, raise an exception `"missing options"`.
- For each option, if its option string is in the `filters` dictionary, then filter the `content` by passing the `content` and `word_pairs` to the option's filter.
- Raise an exception `"invalid option"` for any option that is passed but not found in the `filters` dictionary.
