# Longest Word

In Doc2Doc, we have a search function to find the longest word in a document.

## Assignment

Complete the `find_longest_word` function without a loop. It accepts string inputs, `document`, and optional `longest_word`, which is the current longest word and defaults to an empty string.

- Check if the first word is longer than the current `longest_word`, then recur for the rest of the document.
- Ensure there are no potential [index errors](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError).

_Assume that a "word" means a series of any consecutive non-whitespace characters. For example, `longest_word("How are you?")` should return the string `"you?"`._
