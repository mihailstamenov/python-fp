# Recursion Review

Recursion is _so dang useful_ with tree-like structures because we don't always know how deep they're nested. Stop and think about how you would write nested loops to traverse a tree of arbitrary depth... it's not easy, is it?

```py
for item in tree:
    for nested_item in item:
        for nested_nested_item in nested_item:
            for nested_nested_nested_item in nested_nested_item:
                # ... WHEN DOES IT END???
```

I most often use recursion on tree-like problems (file systems, nested dictionaries, etc). If I'm just iterating over a one-dimensional list then a loop (_gasp..._) is typically simpler, even if it's not as "pure" in the academic sense.

_Remember: The rules of functional programming are just philosophies to help you write better code, but it's not always the right tool for the job._ The same goes for any programming paradigm.
