# Recursion Quiz

Consider the following function:

```py
def countdown(n):
    print(n)
    if n == 0:
        return
    else:
        countdown(n - 1)
```

Which line contains the base case?

Which line contains the recursive call?

What would happen if we swapped countdown(n - 1) with countdown(n) for n > 0
