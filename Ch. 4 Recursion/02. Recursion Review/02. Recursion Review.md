# Recursion Review

-- [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/244/)

_I hate explaining jokes, but in case you don't get the comic:_ The joke is that the characters within the Dungeons and Dragons game are _also_ playing their own Dungeons and Dragons game. Maybe _their_ character's game of DnD also has characters playing DnD, and so on, recursively forever.

## Another Example

```py
def print_chars(word, i):
    if i == len(word):
        return
    print(word[i])
    print_chars(word, i + 1)

print_chars("Hello", 0)
# H
# e
# l
# l
# o
```
